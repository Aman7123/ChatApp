# ChatApp

This project was created for my CIS390 class, simply its a chat app that has a server and client side. As long as one server is running you can have as many clients as you have memory.

## Getting Started

The most simple way to run this program is to check out my most recent build of it located in the "JarBuild" folder.

### Prerequisites

Know how to use Windows PowerShell

### Installing

If you would like to compile the code yourself, I recommend the eclipse IDE.

## To Run Server

The server will open on any port you can give it.
```
java -jar ChatServer <port-number>
```

## To Run Client

When running the client you must know the ip address, whether that be on the LAN or WWW.
```
java -jar ChatClient <ip-address of server> <port>
```

## Versioning

This project will most likely only receive this version which I'm listing as V-1.0
